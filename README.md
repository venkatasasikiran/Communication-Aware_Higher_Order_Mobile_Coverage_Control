# Communication-Aware_Higher_Order_Mobile_Coverage_Control

With the advancement of technology, it is possible to deploy a large group of mobile sensors for exploration, surveillance, and environmental monitoring. A higher-order spatial allocation of sensors for optimal coverage was studied by Jiang, with the help of Voronoi partitions, where more than one mobile sensor is responsible for each partition. However, the study assumed that the agents have continuous access to the state information about their neighbors and can update their control signals continuously. These assumptions are not fair in the context of cyber-physical systems.

In this project, inspired by the work on self-triggered coordination of robotic networks by Nowzari, I proposed a self-triggered strategy where communication usage is minimum, and mobile sensors have the liberty to choose when to communicate.
